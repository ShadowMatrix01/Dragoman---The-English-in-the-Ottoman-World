# Dragoman: The English in the Ottoman-World
Dragoman: The English in the Ottoman World is an educational experience which explores five vignettes which detail the experiences of English travelers in the Ottoman Empire. This project was developed by two courses in Fall 2025 at <b>Central Connecticut State University</b> in coordination with <b>CCSU's Game Studies Minor, History Department, and Yale's Lewis Walpole Library. </b>The game development was led by CCSU's GMST 100: Intro to Game Studies course and the research and historical consulting was led by CCSU's HIST 402: The Ottomans: Rise of an Empire course. Together, the over 60 students between these two courses, coordinated by Dr. Tyler Kynn, worked to create 5 dialogue-based interactive narratives which are inspired by 5 different primary historical documents related to English travelers in the early modern Ottoman Empire. Four of the five documents can be found at Yale's Lewis Walpole Library in Farmington, CT where the finished game was presented with the documents at the end of both courses.
